CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcatkin_simple.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "catkin_simple", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin_simple"
  with any of the following names:

    catkin_simpleConfig.cmake
    catkin_simple-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "catkin_simple" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "catkin_simple_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "catkin_simple" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
